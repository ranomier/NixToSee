# This value determines the NixOS release from which the default
# settings for stateful data, like file locations and database versions
# on your system were taken. Itâ€˜s perfectly fine and recommended to leave
# this value at the release version of the first install of this system.
# Before changing this value read the documentation for this option
# (e.g. man configuration.nix or on https://nixos.org/nixos/options.html).
